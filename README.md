# About

A simplified and working clone of the popular version control platform, <b>GitHub</b>, using React library and Apollo Graphql.

I work as a frontend developer, and I have created this showcase product during my free time. It serves as modern react codebase that reflects real-world practices.

## Features

- Written in `React JS`/ `TypeScript`.
- The repositories are queried using `Apollo client` from `GitHub GraphQL API`.
- `Redux Toolkit` is used for global state management.
- The UI is styled using `Bootstrap 5`.
- Scalable and easy to understand project structure.
- Users can search and view GitHub repositories through it. Demo
